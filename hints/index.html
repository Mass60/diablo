    <p>Tip one:Always save when you can</p>

      class="save"

    <p>
      Now, This seems obvious, but here's the thing: This game doesn't have
      autosave, so if you just go ahead expecting to have you progress saved,
      and then you die, you will go all the way back to the town, and have to
      backtrack all the way to where you were before. This is not a good thing,
      so always save, and not just when you are at low health or before aboss:
      whenever you have free time, reload.
    </p>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <p>Tip two: AVOID THE YELLOW ZOMBIES</p>
    <img

    />
    <p>
      These yellow zombies are called the Black Death, and if they hit you, you
      lose one hp point, permenantly. You can get more hp points over the course
      of the game, but always be careful on any floors these are on (3 to 5),
      especially if you're melee..
    </p>
    <p>Tip 3:Get Teleport as soon as you can</p>

      class="teleport"
    />
    <p>
      Teleport is one of the most useful spells in the game, esecially for
      warriors. It's uses are many and useful, such as teleporting close to
      ranged enemies as a warrior to not have to approch them yourself and take
      any hits, teleporting to another room if you're getting overwhelmed,and
      moving through level quickly.
